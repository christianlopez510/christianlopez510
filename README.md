- 👋 Hi, I’m @christianlopez510
- 👀 I’m interested in game design and app building, along with a little Arduino tinkering here and there.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Computer Science, with some fun little projects along the way.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building custom games within the Roblox Studio, using Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's to make projects 
- for my car and home, and to just tinker with whatever I can.
